This repository contains code for a simulation for Railyard Operations. The current status of the code has only the Greedy implementation functioning properly with Dynamic Programming algorithm still being implemented. The Branch-and-Bound algorithm has been discarded due to time constraints and difficulty in properly implementing it. 

The simulation works by initializing InboundYard and OutboundYard objects, these are initialized by the Driver class. The Driver class will also initialize a Simulation class, Arrival class, and DataTracker class. The Driver will provide information to the Simulation class regarding what algorithm and policy is to be used for the simulation. A loop will be used such that the simulation will run for an 8-hour shift. The timer will increment based on operations occurring in the Railyard. Movement of railcars to the InboundYard, OutboundYard, and out of the railyard are ten seconds per car.

The actual simulation works by having railcars stored in a list within another list that describes tracks. This nesting is done for the sake of clarity and to have each object within the simulation make logical sense. An easier method could be done, though it would have more abstraction within the simulation and could result in difficulties in understanding the simulation at a glance. The lists are treated similar to a queue with only the 'first' train and railcar being considered for classification, each track having their 'first''s priority value compared with others when deciding which train or railcar will be classified. Classification being done by first adding a railcar or train to the OutboundYard and then removing it from the InboundYard. The algorithm for classification will continue classifying railcars and trains until no valid train or railcar can be classified.

Policy was mentioned earlier in this document and refers to how trains and railcars are viewed. The three polcies are TMP-Split, TMP-Full, and TMP-Last which have been previously mentioned in works done by Boysen et. al.. TMP-Split treats all railcars as independent with classification being done based only by the railcar's priority compared with other options. TMP-Full views railcars only as the trains they are part of, classification is done based on the total priority of the train compared to other trains. TMP-Split is a combination of both TMP-Full and TMP-Split, classification is done based on the total priority of trains compared to one another until the last train is reached at which point individual railcars can be classified instead of the entire train.
